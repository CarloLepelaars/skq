# Scikit-Q

Convenient Quantum Components in Scikit-Learn Style. Constructed according to scikit-learn API conventions and works within Pipelines. 

## Features

- `gates` -> Quantum gate implementations.
- `qubit_transformers` -> Quantum transformations on statevectors.
- `encoders` -> Encode classical data into valid quantum states.
- `pipeline` -> QuantumPipeline for convenient visualization and analysis.
- `graph` -> Quantum graph algorithms.
- `cluster` -> Quantum clustering algorithms.
- `svm` -> Quantum kernel methods.


## Install

Install `scikit-q` from PyPi by running:

```bash
pip install scikit-q
```
