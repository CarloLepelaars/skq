# Scikit-Q (skq)

Classical Quantum Components in Scikit-Learn Style.

## Why Scikit-Q?

- Exploration: Play with quantum information concepts from core building blocks (numpy, scikit-learn).
- Education: Learn quantum computing concepts and algorithms using fundamental Python objects.
- Integration: Combine classical scikit-learn components with quantum components in a single pipeline.
- Democratize quantum for data scientists: Develop quantum algorithms in your favorite environment and easily export to your favorite quantum computing platform for running on real quantum hardware.

## Features

- `gates` -> Quantum gate implementations.
- `qubit_transformers` -> Quantum transformations on statevectors.
- `encoders` -> Encode classical data into valid quantum states.
- `pipeline` -> QuantumPipeline for convenient visualization and analysis.
- `graph` -> Quantum graph algorithms.
- `cluster` -> Quantum clustering algorithms.
- `svm` -> Quantum kernel methods.


## Install

Install `scikit-q` from PyPi by running:
